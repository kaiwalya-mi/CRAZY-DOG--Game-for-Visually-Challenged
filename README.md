2D Obstacle Alert Game
A Web Development Project Using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
This is my first web development project, a 2D running game built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and plain vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks. I integrated the sound() library to enhance accessibility, specifically targeting visually impaired users.

Project Purpose
According to the World Health Organization, over 2.2 billion people worldwide are blind or visually impaired, with 284 million classified as visually impaired and 39 million as blind. Vision loss is linked to social isolation, anxiety, and depression, with a recent CDC study noting that 1 in 4 adults with vision loss experience these mental health challenges. This game aims to address these issues by providing an accessible, interactive experience for visually impaired individuals, using sound as a key feature to alert players to in-game obstacles.

What the Game Does
In this 2D running game, the player’s objective is to jump over obstacles as they approach. A beep sound plays when an obstacle nears, serving as an auditory cue for visually impaired players to time their jumps. The game combines simple graphics with sound-based navigation, making it both functional and inclusive.

Technical Details
Technologies Used: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.
Sound Integration: Utilized the sound() library to implement audio alerts for obstacle detection.
Game Mechanics: Players control a character that must jump over obstacles in a continuous 2D environment, relying on sound cues for timing.

 How to Play:-


Using sound in the game is one of the basic requirements and of utmost importance if the game is for visually challenged. To add the sound in JavaScript we use audio class in our game to create instances of the audio class by defining the source. When the certain condition is met the inbuilt method sound () gets activated.

In this game first the tutorial will guide the player on how to play. Then it will alert the player about the oncoming objects using the beep sound. When the collision occurs a ‘game over’ sound informs the player of the collision. And when the player hits the enter key the game will restart with a sound.
